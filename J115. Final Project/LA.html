    <h3>11:15 a.m. : Interview with Jared Van Lehn, our waiter at the Butcher's Daughter</h3>
    <p>Jared Van Lehn was adopted by two Mormon parents in Los Angeles, California. He grew up near Venice Beach — in historically wealthy neighborhoods — where he cultivated his love for comedy, fairness and business before he went to Santa Clara State.</p>
      
      <p>We met Jared at the Butcher’s Daughter in Venice Beach on a surreptitious Thursday morning. Hungry and caffeine-deprived, we made it to Venice only to meet a new friendly face who once held three jobs at once and performed as a stand-up comic.</p>

        <p>Jared sat down with us as he described what the current Black Lives Matter movement meant to him as a 30-year-old Black American. “I’m a millennial, you know. So I’ve been feeling this anger for a while. But now with you guys out there we feel confirmed and reinforced in our feelings. So I get out there because you’re protesting for me.”</p>

        <p>The anger that has recently radicalized diverse populations across the United States after the George Floyd killing has been festering for years, according to Jared. This anger was never accepted, particularly among Black populations, because it was castigated under the stereotype of “angry Black man” or “just another Black man” as if it was inherently “Black” to be angry about one’s societal position.</p>
      
        <p>Here is a portion of our interview with Jared:</p>
